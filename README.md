# 🏎️ 2D Racing Game (Pygame Project)

This is a simple 2D Racing Game developed in Python using the Pygame library. It was built as a college mini-project to demonstrate basic game development concepts like object movement, collision-safe boundaries, rendering, and interactive controls. The game simulates a car racing around a custom-designed circular track.
